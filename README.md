# üöÄ CI Template: Deploy to S3 + CloudFront

This CI pipeline streamlines the **building and deployment of static applications** to an **S3 bucket**, coupled with **automatic CloudFront cache invalidation**.

-----

## ‚úÖ Features

  * **App Build Process**: Automates the build of your static application.
  * **S3 Upload with Cache-Control**: Efficiently uploads your built application to S3 with optimized cache control settings.
  * **Automatic CloudFront Invalidation**: Ensures immediate content updates by invalidating CloudFront cache after deployment.
  * **Multi-environment Support**: Configurable for different deployment environments (e.g., Stage, Production).

-----

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

### Project Configuration

To ensure dynamic routing and seamless integration, configure your frontend project (e.g., with Vite + React) as follows:

  * **React Router DOM**: When using `react-router-dom` with `createBrowserRouter`, set the `basename` using the environment variable `import.meta.env.REACT_APP_BROWSER_ROUTER_BASENAME`. This variable will be exposed during the CI build process.
  * **Vite Configuration**: In your `vite.config.ts`, define the `base` property like this:
    ```typescript
    base: process.env.REACT_APP_BROWSER_ROUTER_BASENAME || '/',
    ```

### üåê `BASENAME` Configuration for Multiple Frameworks

During the CI build process, the value of the `PREVIEW_PREFIX` environment variable is used to define the **basename** (or base path) of the application ‚Äî i.e., the subdirectory where the app will be served (e.g., `/preview-123/`).

The following environment variables are exported and customized for each supported framework to ensure proper routing behavior when deployed under a subpath:

```bash
export REACT_APP_BROWSER_ROUTER_BASENAME="/${{ env.PREVIEW_PREFIX }}"
export NEXT_PUBLIC_BASENAME="/${{ env.PREVIEW_PREFIX }}"
export NG_APP_BASENAME="/${{ env.PREVIEW_PREFIX }}/"
export VUE_APP_BASENAME="/${{ env.PREVIEW_PREFIX }}"
````

#### üîπ React (Create React App)

* **Variable:** `REACT_APP_BROWSER_ROUTER_BASENAME`
* **Usage:** Passed to `<BrowserRouter basename={...}>`
* **Accessed via:** `process.env.REACT_APP_BROWSER_ROUTER_BASENAME`

#### üîπ Next.js

* **Variable:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASENAME`
* **Usage:** Used for custom route handling or asset paths
* **Accessed via:** `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASENAME`

#### üîπ Angular

* **Variable:** `NG_APP_BASENAME`
* **Usage:** Used as `APP_BASE_HREF` or passed to `--base-href` during build
* **Accessed via:** Depends on strategy (recommends `@ngx-env/builder`)

#### üîπ Vue.js (Vue CLI)

* **Variable:** `VUE_APP_BASENAME`
* **Usage:** Used to configure `publicPath` in `vue.config.js`
* **Accessed via:** `process.env.VUE_APP_BASENAME`

### üõ†Ô∏è Note

Each variable follows the environment conventions of its respective framework and should be used during build time or app initialization. This ensures the application works correctly when deployed under a subdirectory (`/${PREVIEW_PREFIX}/`).

### üìå Why set the basename?

When deploying a Single Page Application (SPA) using Static Site Generation (SSG) ‚Äî such as with **Vite** ‚Äî to environments like Amazon S3, you often serve your site under a **subpath** (e.g., `https://example.com/my-app/`) instead of the root (`/`).

By setting the `basename` in your **router** and the `base` in your **Vite config**, you ensure:

#### ‚úÖ Correct routing
React Router knows that all routes should be resolved relative to the subpath.

#### ‚úÖ Correct asset loading
JS, CSS, and other static assets will be linked using the correct base path (e.g., `/my-app/assets/...`) in the generated `index.html`.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Without this configuration
The app may break when accessed from a subdirectory:

- Routes may return **404**
- Static assets may **fail to load**

#### üîÅ Always match the deployed subpath
Avoid broken links and routing issues by ensuring the subpath used in your configuration matches the one used during deployment ‚Äî **regardless of the framework or setup** you're using.

## GitHub Actions Workflow Files

To set up the CI/CD pipeline, you need to create a `.github/workflows` folder in the root of your repository. Inside this folder, add the following workflow files:

  * `start_clear_preview.yml`
  * `start_push_preview.yml`
  * `start_push_prod_release.yml`
  * `start_push_stage_release.yml`

## GitHub Actions Secrets

For the CI pipeline to function correctly, you must add the following **secrets** to your repository's "Actions" settings:

#### Stage Secrets

These secrets are prefixed with `STAGE_` for your staging environment:

  * `STAGE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS IAM access key ID.
  * `STAGE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS IAM secret access key.
  * `STAGE_AWS_REGION`: The AWS region where your S3 bucket is located.
  * `STAGE_S3_BUCKET_NAME`: The name of your S3 bucket for the stage environment.
  * `STAGE_CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID`: The CloudFront distribution ID for the stage environment.
  * `STAGE_WF_GITHUB_TOKEN`: A GitHub classic token with `repo` permissions, used for workflow operations.

  > üìú AWS SSM Parameter - Project envs

  * `STAGE_AWS_SSM_PARAMETER_PATH`: **Name** of the parameter in AWS SSM Parameter Store that contains environment variables specific to your project in stage environment.

  > üí° **Note:** Always when some pull-request is created, one AWS SSM Parameter Store is created with auto refering PR number, ".env.stage.pr.x".

  > üí° **Important:** All parameters must be stored as **String** type values in AWS SSM Parameter Store.

#### Production Secrets

These secrets are for your production environment:

  * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS IAM access key ID.
  * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS IAM secret access key.
  * `AWS_REGION`: The AWS region where your S3 bucket is located.
  * `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: The name of your S3 bucket for the production environment.
  * `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID`: The CloudFront distribution ID for the production environment.
  * `WF_GITHUB_TOKEN`: A GitHub classic token with `repo` permissions, used for workflow operations.

  > üìú AWS SSM Parameter - Project envs

  * `AWS_SSM_PARAMETER_PATH`: **Name** of the parameter in AWS SSM Parameter Store that contains environment variables for your project in production environment.

  > üí° **Important:** All parameters must be stored as **String** type values in AWS SSM Parameter Store.
